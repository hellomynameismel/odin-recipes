            <h2>Fried egg cooked in the middle of a toast</h2>
        </p>
        When you wake up hungry and feel playful, a hole in one hits just the spot. 
        <p>Put on some music, grab your favorite bread (I'm a huge fan cinnamon-raisin bread for this) and don't be shy with the butter.</p> 
        <p>Let's go!</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>2 slices of cinnamon-raisin bread (or use whatever you'd like)</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>pat of butter</li>
            <li>salt and pepper</li>
            <li>maple syrup <em>(optional)</em></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a cast-iron skillet to medium high.</li>
            <li>Cut out a hole in your toast. Feel free to use a knife (neater) or just tear with your hands (more fun).</li>
            <li>Butter the pan lightly, then place the bread down (wiping the butter on it).</li>
            <li>After a few mins (when bread side down is toasted), butter the top of the bread then flip over.</li>
            <li>Crack the egg in a bowl and season with S&P. Slide an egg in each hole.</li>
            <li>When the egg white starts to turn opaque at the bottom, add a pat of butter to the top of the egg, then flip again. The butter is optional if your pan is well-seasoned, but it definitely adds flavor!</li>
            <li>Flip onto your plate when the eggs are done. Timing depends on how runny you want the yolks. I take mine off after about twenty seconds and top is just solidified, with the whites slightly translucent and the yolk runny.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Et voila! Congrats on your hole in one!</p>
